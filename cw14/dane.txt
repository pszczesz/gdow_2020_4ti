If filename is of the form "scheme://...", it is assumed to be a URL and PHP will 
search for a protocol handler (also known as a wrapper) for that scheme. If no wrappers
 for that protocol are registered, PHP will emit a notice to help you track potential problems 
 in your script and then continue as though 
filename specifies a regular file.
